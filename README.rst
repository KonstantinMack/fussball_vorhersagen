The aim of this project is to create prediction model for football matches.


Description
===========

This project started as my final project for my data science bootcamp. The Notebook with the presentation (model_final.ipynb) can be found in the folder "src".
I use various machine learning and deep learning techniques in this project to create football prediction models.
A detailed documentation of this project can be found here: LINK

Each week I will post the resulting predictions for each match from the top 5 European leagues (England, Spain, Germany, Italy France) below:
