Football Predictions
====================

The aim of this project is to create football prediction models which can beat the bookies.


Description
===========

This project started as my final project for a data science bootcamp. The Jupyter-Notebook with the presentation (model_final.ipynb) can be found in the folder "src".
I use various machine learning and deep learning techniques in this project to create football prediction models.
A more detailed documentation of this project can be found here: LINK

Each week I will post my predictions for the Premier League below:
